# Material_similarity
* Cosine similarity to predict similar material for Finite Element Analysis.
* Non Linear Finite Element Analysis is a time consuming and iterative process if we have a component failure.
* Choosing similar material during component failure is a tough process.
* Cost reduction by choosing a slightly similar low grade material is also possible by establishing this concept.
